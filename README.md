## Compiling the project
_I used Xcode 12 whilst developing this application (Version 12.3)_

1. Clone the project:<br>`git clone https://github.com/ElliotJBall/quicksize`
2. Switch to the directory:<br>`cd quicksize/`
3. Open the project in Xcode:<br>`open quicksize.xcodeproj`
4. Compile and Launch using <span title="Command + R">âŒ˜R</span>

## Notes
- I am deliberately filtering out resolutions with a sub 60 (AKA 30hz) refresh rate. If you want them to also be displayed in the list fork the project and remove: `roundedRefreshRate < 59` from the `AppDelegate.swift` file on line `63`
